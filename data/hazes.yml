- Hey, you smell funny.
- Hey where did you get that quip? The toilet store?
- Wow, that's dumb.
- Dingus.
- Doofus.
- I would insult you, but it's beneath me.
- Imbecile.
- Sorry, I normally just space out when you're talking.
- Completely unremarkable.
- Could you try being interesting for once?
- Oh, were you talking?
- So, uh, does anyone cool have anything to say?
- Yikes.
- Really?
- Well I *was* having a good day, but then you decided to start talking.
- Why are you even here?
- Ech.
- Oh, don't make me laugh.
- Did you need something, or were you just trying to waste my time?
- Sigh.
